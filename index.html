        <h2>What makes Zen Garden interesting?</h2>
        <p>Zen Garden is interesting because it is an interactive website that encourages individuals to learn and develop thier CSS skills by customizing their own versions of the website. I thought it was interesting how the website was built to easily transition between different designs, as the links were embedded into each site. </p>
   
        <h2>What was my favorite CSS design?</h2>
        <!-- Describe at least one aspect of the layout given the reading that you compleated for today. -->
        <p>My favorite CSS design off the site was easily Steel by Steffen Knoeller. I was impressed by how each div element was able to move so easily. This is an advanced design which was absent from the book. The CSS coding for animation uses properties such as animation-duration, and animation-direction. One aspect of the layout that was in the reading would be its consistant padding measurements. While the moving signs in the design varied in size, using a consistant padding measurement (50px and 15px) made the website look very neat and organized.
